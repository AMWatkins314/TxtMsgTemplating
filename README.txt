Program: SMSMsg.java

Description: This program outputs

Usage: java SMSMsg <template_file> <token_mapping_file> <msgcount>

Example Usage: java SMSMsg template_1.txt tokens.txt c=1

Required Input: template_file - the file containing the message template to use.
                token_mapping_file - the file containing the token-value mappings to substitute into the template. 

Optional Input: The msgcount flag c=1 - specifying c=1 as the third argument causes the message count to be pre-pended to all sub-messages.
                By default, the msgcount flag is off so no message counts are pre-pended to sub-messages.

Output: A message is output as several sub-messages that are less than or equal to the SMSMsg MAX_LENGTH (which by default is 160 characters).
        The message is generated by replacing tokens in the template_file with their corresponding values from the token_mapping_file.
        If the optional msgcount flag c=1 is specified then each sub-message is pre-pended with the current message count.
        Note that if any arguments are incorrect that a usage message is output.
